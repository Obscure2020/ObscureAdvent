# Obscure's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) Code
Beginning in 2022, Obscure began attempting [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)'s annual puzzles. While Obscure had been aware of these puzzles for a few years previous, 2022 marked the first year that Obscure made a consistent (yet not always successful) effort to complete the puzzles daily. This repo was made to store Obscure's final, working solutions to the puzzles.

## Running
Obscure may approach each problem in a variety of ways in any language of his choosing. He sometimes also returns to old problems and completes them in more than one language for fun and learning. If you would like to test any of Obscure's solutions for yourself, check that you can comply with these tips:
1. Ensure that you have a working copy of a recent edition of the language you'd like to test installed on your system.
1. Download your copy of the input for the puzzle in question, and save that input as a file named `input.txt` in the directory that contains the solution you'd like to test.
1. For a Java solution, Obscure recommends using the command `javac *.java && java -ea Main` to compile and run his code.

## Issues
If you encounter an error in which Obscure's code does not seem to work as intended, feel free to open an issue and report your findings. You may also open an issue if you personally ***take*** issue (pun intended) with one of Obscure's implementations. Obscure appreciates input from the community, and is constantly looking to learn more and improve his skills.
