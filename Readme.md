# Obscure's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) Code
Beginning in 2022, Obscure began attempting [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)'s annual puzzles. While Obscure had been aware of these puzzles for a few years previous, 2022 marked the first year that Obscure made a consistent (yet not always successful) effort to complete the puzzles daily. This repo was made to store Obscure's final, working solutions to the puzzles.

## Running
If you would like to test any of Obscure's solutions for yourself, follow these instructions:
1. Ensure that you have a working copy of a recent edition of the JDK properly installed in your system.
1. Download your copy of the input for the puzzle in question.
1. Save that input as a file named `input.txt` in the directory corresponding to the puzzle in question.
1. Run the command `javac *.java && java Main` in the same directory.

## Issues
If you encounter an error in which Obscure's code does not seem to work as intended, feel free to open an issue and report your findings. You may also open an issue if you personally ***take*** issue (pun intended) with one of Obscure's implementations. Obscure appreciates input from the community, and is constantly looking to learn more and improve his skills.
