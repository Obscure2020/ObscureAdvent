# Obscure's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) Code
Beginning in 2022, Obscure began attempting [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)'s annual puzzles. While Obscure had been aware of these puzzles for a few years previous, 2022, marked the first year that Obscure actually tried to follow the puzzles daily. This repo was made to store Obscure's final, working solutions to the puzzles.

If you would like to test any of Obscure's solutions for yourself, follow these instructions:
1. Ensure that you have a working copy of a recent edition of the JDK properly installed in your system.
1. Download the your copy of the input for the puzzle in question.
1. Save that input as a file named `input.txt` in the folder corresponding to the puzzle in question.
1. Run the command `javac *.java` in the same folder.
1. Run the command `java Main` in the same folder.
